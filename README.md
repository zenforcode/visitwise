## VisitWise: Proposal Overview

We are developing a next-generation, AI-powered travel booking engine where multiple AI agents work in an orchestrated manner
to create a seamless booking experience. The system automates flights, hotels, car rentals, events, and meetups using AI-driven dynamic pricing, itinerary optimization and real-time adjustments. AI agents work collaboratively, each handling a specific task‚Äîe.g., flight optimization, cost negotiation, user personalization, and real-time event integration. The UI is primarily voice-driven via Siri and AI chatbots, with web & mobile dashboards for full control. Payment will be thru stripe and gpay integration.
